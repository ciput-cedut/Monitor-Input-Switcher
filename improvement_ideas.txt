# Monitor Input Switcher - Improvement Ideas

Here are a few ideas for improving the tool, ranging from simple to more advanced:

### 1. Command-Line Interface (CLI)✅

*   **Idea:** Add a command-line interface to allow switching inputs without opening the GUI. This would be useful for power users who want to create scripts or hotkeys to switch to specific inputs.
*   **Example Usage:**
    ```bash
    monitor_manager.exe --monitor 1 --input HDMI1
    ```
*   **Benefits:** Faster switching, scriptable, can be integrated with other tools.

### 2. Favorite or Quick-Switch Buttons✅

*   **Idea:** Add a "Favorites" section to the GUI where users can save their most frequently used monitor/input combinations. This would allow for one-click switching to a preferred setup.
*   **Benefits:** Faster and more convenient for users who regularly switch between the same inputs.

### 3. Automatic Switching Based on Active Window

*   **Idea:** This is a more advanced feature. The tool could automatically switch a monitor's input when a specific application becomes the active window. For example, when a game is launched, the monitor could automatically switch to the input connected to the gaming PC.
*   **Benefits:** A "smarter" tool that anticipates the user's needs.

### 4. Brightness and Contrast Controls

*   **Idea:** Since the `monitorcontrol` library also supports adjusting brightness and contrast, these features could be added to the GUI. This would turn the tool into a more general-purpose monitor control utility.
*   **Benefits:** More functionality and value for the user.

### 5. Theme and Appearance Customization✅

*   **Idea:** Allow the user to change the application's theme (light/dark mode) and accent color. `customtkinter` makes this relatively easy to implement.
*   **Benefits:** A more modern and visually appealing application.

### 6. Error when Downloading

*   **Idea:** Prevent warning that shown up when first time downloading from server. (Caused by untrusted source?)


### 7. Monitor Input Differentiation

*   **Idea:** Indicate which monitor input that is connected to PC. May also indicate what is connected to each input(may consume more time?)
*   **Benefits:** User can easily determine which input to switch.
